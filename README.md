# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineer program at Practicum by Yandex. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- Creating separate pages for nav links rather than having one long page. Individual pages would allow for more in depth information such nutrition info for the menu.
- Add written recipes to recipes section so that the user doesn't have to watch the video to see all ingredients and steps.
- The reservation section should prompt a message for the user if the reservation cannot be accommodated.
